This is part of a collaboratory set up at The Next Edge around the idea of Collaborating like a hacker, see Harlan's post [Collaboratory Now](http://www.harlantwood.net/pub/Collaboratory_Now/index.html). It is also inspired by [Clay Shirky's TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html) on "how democracies can take a lesson from the Internet".

The idea is to use the technology of distributed version control made available through open source ethos and practices for wide scale collaborative projects with social orientation and scope (laws, blueprints, requirements, best practices etc...) that can benefit from crowd incremental participation.

I am concentrating here on:
* The requirements for a platform to turn open ended conversations into action (Conversation to Action - Pull Platform)
* A system to explore the edges and alternatives from the position a user occupies (Streams and Masters of the Shift)
